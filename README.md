# Quantum serverless

Quantum Serverless is a user-friendly tool that enables you to easily run complex quantum computing tasks. 
With this software, you can execute Qiskit programs as long running jobs and distribute them across multiple CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. 
This means you can take on more complex quantum-classical programs and run them with ease. 
You don't have to worry about configuration or scaling up computational resources, as Quantum Serverless takes care of everything for you.

### Quickstart
This Quickstart section guides users to easily deploy QuantumServerless infrastructure and run a simple example.
For user convenience, this section assumes that users will deploy the infrastructure in a local environment using Docker and test examples within the deployed Jupyter notebook.

1. Prepare local QuantumServerless infrastructure
   1. Install Docker
      If Docker is not installed on your system, follow the directions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker on your system.
   1. Clone the Quantum Serverless repository
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/quantum-serverless.git
      ```
   1. Run QuantumServerless infrastructure
      Execute Docker Compose using the following commands. (Note: Make sure to stop any running Jupyter Notebook servers before proceeding.)
      ```shell
      cd quantum-serverless/
      sudo docker compose --profile jupyter up
      ```
      
      The output should resemble the following.
      ```
      ~/quantum-serverless$ sudo docker compose --profile jupyter up

      ```

      Now you can access the deployed QuantumServerless infrastructure using the built-in JupyterLab.
      
1. Access the JupyterLab environment
   Open `localhost:8888` in your web browser. The default token for the JupyterLab is `123`
1. Write your first example program
   In the JupyterLab, create a new file, `program.py`, in the `work` directory.
   
   Save [this example python code](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/quickstart/index.html#id8).  

   Now, you are ready to run the first program.
1. Run the program
   In the JupyterLab, create a new notebook in the same directory as your program, and execute [this python code](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/quickstart/index.html#id9).

   You can check the job status and get the result.

   ```
   job.status()
   # <JobStatus.SUCCEEDED: 'SUCCEEDED'>
   
   job.logs()
   # 2023-09-21 03:48:40,286\tINFO worker.py:1329 -- Using address 172.18.0.4:6379 set in the environment variable RAY_ADDRESS\n2023-09-21 03:48:40,286\tINFO worker.py:1458 -- Connecting to existing Ray cluster at address: 172.18.0.4:6379...\n2023-09-21 03:48:40,295\tINFO worker.py:1633 -- Connected to Ray cluster. View the dashboard at \x1b[1m\x1b[32m172.18.0.4:8265 \x1b[39m\x1b[22m\n
   ```
   ```
   job.status()
   # '{"quasi_dists": [{"1": 0.5071335183298108, "5": 0.4334908044837378, "7": 0.0593756771864515}, {"1": 0.9161860602334094, "5": 0.0838139397665906}, {"2": 0.4999999999999999, "3": 0.4999999999999999}]}'
   ```

   That's all!
