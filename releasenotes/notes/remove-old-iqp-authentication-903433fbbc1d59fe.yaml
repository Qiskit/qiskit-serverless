    The legacy IBM Quantum authentication channel (``ibm_quantum``) has been removed.
    Users should migrate to using the IBM Quantum Platform channel (``ibm_quantum_platform``)
    for authentication. The authentication logic has been simplified to support only
    ``ibm_cloud`` and ``ibm_quantum_platform`` channels. When no channel header is provided
    and a CRN is present, the system defaults to ``ibm_quantum_platform``.
