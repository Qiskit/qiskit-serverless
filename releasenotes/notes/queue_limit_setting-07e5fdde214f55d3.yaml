features:

    Added a new gateway setting to limit the number of active jobs per user. 
    By setting the environment variable ``LIMITS_JOBS_QUEUE_PER_USER``, you can 
    restrict the total number of jobs a user can have across ``QUEUED``, 
    ``PENDING``, and ``RUNNING`` states. The default limit is ``50``.

    Requests to run programs will now return an ``HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`` response 
    if a user attempts to start a new job while they are at their active job limit.
