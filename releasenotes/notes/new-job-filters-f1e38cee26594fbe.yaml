    Enhanced ``client.jobs()`` and ``function.jobs()`` behavior with
    new filters to improve the management of the different jobs. Now you
    can filter by ``status`` and by ``created_after`` to retrieve those
    specific jobs. For example::

      # Filtering by status it will retrieve all the jobs with that status
      client.jobs(status="SUCCEEDED")

      # The same it will apply after a specific date
      time_filter = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
      client.jobs(created_after=time_filter)

      # And all these new filters can be combined with the Qiskit Function filter
      # to be able to return running jobs from the specific Qiskit Function
      function.jobs(status="RUNNING")
