fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in the json decoder that would crop the response details to the first character when
    gateway errors were raised. This utility now forwards the full error message to the raised
    ``QiskitServerlessException``.

  - |
    Fixed error handling when a function is not found. Instead of providing a
    bare 404 error, the ``QiskitServerlessException`` now contains a more meaningful error message::

      QiskitServerlessException:
      | Message: Http bad request.
      | Code: 404
      | Details: User program 'my-program' was not found or you do not have permission to view it.
