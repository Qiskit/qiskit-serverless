prelude: >
    Major refactor in logs to be able to differentiate between Provider logs
    and user logs. Also the logs now are stored in COS keeping backward
    compatibility.
features:
  - |
    The Client added new functions :func:`get_logger()` and :func:`get_provider_logger()`.
    The users should use the :func:`get_logger()` to log their relevant information.
    The providers should use this functions discriminate the relevant information
    for users or providers respectively.
    This will create `[PUBLIC]` and `[PRIVATE]` prefixes under the hood to filter
    the information appropriately
  - |
    The :class:`ServerlessClient` and :class:`Job` added new method :meth:`provider_logs`
    to use the new `/provider_logs` endpoint.
  - |
    The Scheduler is modified to upload logs to COS when job transition from running to
    a terminal state. In this moment the logs will be filtered taking into account the
    prefixes and it will save the information in its corresponding folder inside the COS.
  - |
    The Gateway has new a endpoint `/provider_logs` and `/logs` is modified.
    Both should return:
    1. The COS log for finished jobs if exist. This was previously filtered in the Scheduler
    2. The Ray console if job is running. This is filtered live.
    3. As a fallback, return the logs from the db.
upgrade:
  - |
    Added several quality of life improvements in testing.
