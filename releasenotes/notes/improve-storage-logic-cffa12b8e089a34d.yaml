    Refactored storage service initialization to accept ``Program`` model instances
    instead of individual parameters. The ``FileStorage`` and ``ArgumentsStorage``
    classes now accept a ``function`` parameter (Program model instance)
    rather than separate ``username``, ``function_title``, and ``provider_name`` parameters.
    This change improves code cohesion by reducing the number of parameters passed between
    components and ensures consistent access to program metadata across storage services.
