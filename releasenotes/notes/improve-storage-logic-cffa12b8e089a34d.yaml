fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in ``FunctionRepository.get_user_function()`` where functions with
    providers could be incorrectly returned when searching for user functions without
    providers. The method now correctly filters by ``provider=None`` to ensure only
    user-owned functions without providers are returned. This prevents incorrect
    storage path resolution when users have multiple functions with the same title.
upgrade:
  - |
    Refactored storage service initialization to accept ``Program`` model instances
    instead of individual parameters. The ``FileStorage`` and ``ArgumentsStorage``
    classes now accept a ``function`` parameter (Program model instance)
    rather than separate ``username``, ``function_title``, and ``provider_name`` parameters.
    This change improves code cohesion by reducing the number of parameters passed between
    components and ensures consistent access to program metadata across storage services.
  - |
    Removed unused ``function_title`` and ``provider_name`` parameters from
    ``ProgramViewSet.run()`` method's call to ``job_serializer.save()`` as these
    parameters are no longer used after the storage service refactoring.
