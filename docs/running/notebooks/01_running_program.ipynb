    "# Running a program remotely\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will write a basic program using Quantum Serverless. We will show how to run the program remotely and retrieve the results from the serverless client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to write the program code and save it to a file called [program_1.py](./source_files/program_1.py). This program creates a two-qubit quantum circuit that prepares a Bell state, measures the result, and saves the measured probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the program is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# source_files/program_1.py\n",
    "\n",
    "from qiskit import QuantumCircuit\n",
    "from qiskit.primitives import Sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "from quantum_serverless import save_result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a circuit\n",
    "circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)\n",
    "circuit.h(0)\n",
    "circuit.cx(0, 1)\n",
    "circuit.measure_all()\n",
    "circuit.draw()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instantiate a Sampler to generate a quasi-distribution of the circuit's outputs\n",
    "sampler = Sampler()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the circuit and retrieve the quasi-distribution\n",
    "quasi_dists = sampler.run(circuit).result().quasi_dists\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the result to the serverless client\n",
    "save_result(quasi_dists)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the program, we need to import the necessary classes and configure them. One of these classes is QuantumServerless, which is a client class for interacting with compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "QuantumServerless takes a Provider object as a constructor argument. The Provider object stores configuration information about our compute resources, such as where they are located and how to connect to them. In this example, we will use a provider that is connected to a local Docker Compose setup. In this case, it allows us to run the program locally on our machine. If you want to run the program elsewhere, you will need to provide the corresponding host and authentication details."
