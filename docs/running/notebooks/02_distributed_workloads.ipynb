    "The `distribute_task` decorator converts a function into a distributed task. This means that the function will be executed on compute resources asynchronously and in parallel to the main context of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a converted function, it will return a reference to the function execution instead of the result. In order to get the result back, you need to call the `get` function on the function reference. `get` will wait until the function is finished and return the result of the function execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the program above, we have applied the `distribute_task` decorator to the `distributed_sample` function. This function takes a `QuantumCircuit` as input and returns the quasi distribution for that circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have defined the `distributed_sample` function, we read the circuits from the program arguments using the `get_arguments` function. We then call the `distributed_sample` function for each of the circuits, which creates a reference to each of the function executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These function executions will run in parallel on compute resources, and we get task references as the return type. We store these task references in the `sample_task_references` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have created the task references for each of the function executions, we need to collect the results from these tasks. We do this by calling the `get` function on the list of task references, which waits until all the tasks have completed and returns the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the results, we can save them using the `save_result` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, this program reads the circuits from the program arguments, executes the `distributed_sample` function on each circuit in parallel, collects the results from the function executions, and saves the results."
